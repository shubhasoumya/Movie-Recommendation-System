# Movie Recommendation System Using PySpark

This project demonstrates a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system using PySpark's ALS (Alternating Least Squares) model.

## Features
- Built using Databricks and PySpark.
- Collaborative filtering to predict movie ratings.
- Utilizes a dataset containing user ratings and movie information.

## Dataset
- **Movies Dataset**: [Link to dataset]
- **Ratings Dataset**: [Link to dataset]

## Requirements
- Databricks or Apache Spark setup.
- Python dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).

## Usage
1. Import the notebook into Databricks.
2. Upload the dataset to Databricks.
3. Execute the cells to train and evaluate the recommendation model.

## Results
- The model predicts ratings for user-movie pairs.
- Recommends movies to users based on collaborative filtering.

## Future Work
- Enhance the model with content-based filtering.
- Deploy the recommendation system using a REST API.
